<p>This is my first crack at making sense of code without dipping into too many tutorials or anything like that. I'm slowly learning from Codeacademy and Codeschool, but I like playing with this and learning as I go too. My UX portfolio site is  <a href="http://www.andrewmoto.com/">here</a>,</p>

<p>I'm a retired skateboarder and graffiti artist from San Jose, California. I love all kinds of art and reading about philosophy. Some of my favorite philosophers are Kierkegaard, Hegel, Heidegger, Fouccault, and Zsisek. My father is a Sculptor and my mother is a Human Factors Engineer. I'm the hybrid of living in both of their worlds and observing their work. From an early age, I would be part of my mother's Human Factors experiments during her time at NASA. Summers were spent at my father's studio. Working with him to carve and polish stone, make brass moldings from either clay or wax, and installing sculptures for clients.  .</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
